** Kotlin collection interfaces
*** Tier 1, Iterable: 
An iterable type provides sequential access to its elements via an Iterator.
*** Tier 2, Collection: 
A collection is an iterable that provides additional functionality, allowing you to check if the collection contains a particular element or a collection of elements.

*** Tier 3, MutableIterable:
An iterable that provides a MutableIterator, which allows both accessing the items and removing them.
*** Tier 4, MutableCollection: 
A collection that also provides methods to alter its contained items. For example, you can add and remove elements, and even clear the entire collection.
